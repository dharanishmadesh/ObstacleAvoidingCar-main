# **Obstacle Avoidance Robot with Servo and Ultrasonic Sensor** ü§ñ

This project demonstrates a basic obstacle avoidance robot. The robot uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles within a specified distance and automatically adjusts its direction. A servo motor is used to scan the left and right sides of the robot to choose the best direction for avoiding obstacles.

## **üíª Code Overview**

### **Setup**

- **Servo motor** is attached to Pin 3 and set to the initial position (90 degrees).
- **Ultrasonic sensor** is set up to measure the distance in front of the robot.
- **Motors** are set up for driving the robot, and their directions and speeds are controlled by pins **5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10**.

### **Loop**

1. **Obstacle Detection**:
   - The robot constantly checks the distance using the ultrasonic sensor.
   - If an obstacle is detected within **30 cm**, the robot stops and adjusts its direction using the motors and servo.

2. **Servo Movement**:
   - The servo scans left and right to check for available paths.
   - Depending on the left and right distances, the robot will decide to turn in the direction where no obstacle is present.

3. **Motor Control**:
   - The `rotateMotor()` function adjusts the direction and speed of both motors.
   - If an obstacle is detected, the robot reverses and chooses the best path based on the distance readings.

4. **Regular Movement**:
   - If no obstacles are detected, the robot moves forward at a constant speed.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Code Explanation**

- **Distance Measurement**: The `mySensor.ping_cm()` function is used to measure the distance to any object in front of the robot.
- **Motor Control**: The `rotateMotor()` function controls the direction and speed of both motors. It uses `digitalWrite()` to set the motor direction and `analogWrite()` to control the motor speed.
- **Servo Movement**: The servo is used to scan left and right for obstacles. The robot adjusts its movement based on the readings from both sides.
- **Obstacle Avoidance Logic**: The robot moves forward if no obstacles are detected. If an obstacle is detected, it reverses for a brief moment, checks both left and right for available space, and adjusts the motors accordingly.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Notes**

- Adjust the **distance threshold** (`DISTANCE_TO_CHECK`) to suit your robot's requirements.
- The **servo movement** is set to scan left and right for 500 milliseconds each, but this delay can be adjusted for different scanning behaviors.

## **üí° Future Improvements**

- **Multiple Sensors**: Add more ultrasonic sensors to cover more directions for better obstacle detection.
- **Path Planning Algorithms**: Implement more advanced path planning algorithms like A* or Dijkstra for smarter navigation.
- **Mobile App Control**: Add Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity to control the robot via a mobile app.
- **Speed Control**: Implement adaptive speed control based on obstacle proximity for smoother movement.
